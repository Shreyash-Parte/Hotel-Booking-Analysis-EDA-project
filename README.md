Before visualize any data from the data set we have to do data wrangling.For that we are checked the null value of all the columns.After checking when we got a coloumn which has more number of null values,dropped that coloumns by using 'DROP' method .In this we dropped some coloumnn .When we find minimal number of null values with necessary values as per requirement by using fillna(). Different charts used for data visualization so that better business insights and objects attained.
