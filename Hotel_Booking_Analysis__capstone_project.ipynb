This dataset contain booking information for 'CITY HOTEL' and 'RESORT HOTEL, and includes information such as when the booking was made ,lenth of the stay ,the number of adults ,children and babies and the number of available parking space and some other things .Personal identity information has been removed from the dataset.Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings."

We can also find out which type of hotel room is the most popular and what kind of guests visit the hotel the most.By doing this, we'll gain valuable insights that can help the hotel make better decisions and improve their services for guests.

        "\n",
        "By leveraging these insights and implementing targeted strategies, the client can improve guest satisfaction, increase bookings, optimize revenue, and achieve their business objectives.
